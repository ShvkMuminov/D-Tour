                    has it that Khiva was founded when Shem, son of Noah, discovered a well here.

                    a Silk Road branch to the Caspian Sea and the Volga. In the early 16th century,
                    Khiva was made capital of the Timurid Empire, becoming a busy slave market and
                    pivot of the khanate for the next three centuries. Until Russia finally wrested the
                    region from Timurid grasp in the 19th century, even the boldest hearts feared
                    encounters with these fierce tribesmen and their desert territory. Khiva is an
                    ancient walled city and looks much like it did in centuries past. It is one of the few
